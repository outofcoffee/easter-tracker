# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

## Workflows

### `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration

This workflow runs on all pull requests to the main branch and ensures code quality:

1. Sets up Node.js v22
2. Installs dependencies 
3. Runs all tests
4. Performs linting
5. Verifies the build process

This helps catch issues before they're merged into the main branch.

### `deploy.yml` - Deployment to GitHub Pages

This workflow automatically deploys to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch:

1. Sets up Node.js v22
2. Installs dependencies
3. Runs all tests to ensure code quality
4. Builds the React application
5. Sets up GitHub Pages
6. Uploads the build artifacts
7. Deploys the built files to GitHub Pages
8. Makes the application available at https://outofcoffee.github.io/easter-tracker/
