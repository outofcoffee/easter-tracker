## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22 or newer)
- npm

If you use Node Version Manager (nvm), you can set up the correct Node.js version with:
```bash
nvm use
```
The repository includes an `.nvmrc` file that specifies the correct version.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/outofcoffee/easter-tracker.git
cd easter-tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Testing with Mock Time

For testing different times of day, you can use environment variables to control the Easter Bunny's position:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file to set one of the following:
   - `VITE_MOCK_TIME`: Set specific date AND time (e.g., `2025-04-20T12:30:00Z` for 12:30 PM on Easter)
   - `VITE_MOCK_DATE`: Set only the date but use real time (e.g., `2025-04-20` for Easter day)

3. Enable debug mode to see the current simulated time:
   ```
   VITE_DEBUG=true
   ```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build

# The built files will be in the dist/ directory
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## How It Works

The Easter Bunny Tracker simulates the Easter Bunny's journey around the world. Since Easter is celebrated on different times across the world's timezones, the bunny's journey spans approximately 50 hours - from when Easter day begins in the easternmost timezone (UTC+14) until Easter day ends in the westernmost timezone (UTC-12).

Key Features:
- **Global Easter Period**: The bunny is active during the entire ~50 hour global Easter period
- **Timezone-Aware Delivery**: The bunny visits each city at midnight local time, when children are asleep
- **Realistic Journey**: The bunny travels from east to west, following the progression of midnight across timezones
- **Live Tracking**: See the bunny's current location, city, and progress in real-time
- **Basket Counting**: Watch as the bunny delivers Easter baskets across the world
- **Location-Aware**: Get personalized information about when the bunny will visit your location
- **Sleeping Bunny**: On non-Easter days, see the bunny resting until the next Easter

## Deployment and CI

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The CI workflow runs on all pull requests to the main branch and ensures code quality:
1. Runs all tests
2. Performs linting
3. Verifies the build process

This helps catch issues before they're merged into the main branch.

### Deployment

The deployment workflow automatically deploys to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch:
1. Sets up Node.js v22
2. Runs all tests to ensure code quality
3. Builds the React application
4. Deploys the built files to GitHub Pages
5. Makes the application available at [https://outofcoffee.github.io/easter-tracker/](https://outofcoffee.github.io/easter-tracker/)

The workflow configurations can be found in:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - For continuous integration
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - For deployment to GitHub Pages
