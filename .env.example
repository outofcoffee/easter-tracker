# Enable debug mode to see current time and Easter status
VITE_DEBUG=true

# Set a specific mock time (ISO format)
# This can be used to test different dates and times
# Examples:

# 1. Testing on Easter day (April 20, 2025) at different times:
VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T12:00:00Z  # Noon on Easter

# Other Easter day times to try:
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T00:00:00Z  # Start of Easter (midnight)
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T06:00:00Z  # Early morning (6 AM)
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T18:00:00Z  # Evening (6 PM)
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T23:59:59Z  # End of Easter

# 2. Testing on non-Easter days (to see the sleeping bunny):
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-21T12:00:00Z  # Day after Easter
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-03-20T12:00:00Z  # One month before Easter
