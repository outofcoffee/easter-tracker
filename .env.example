# Enable debug mode to see current time and Easter status
VITE_DEBUG=true

# There are two ways to override the time for testing:

# Option 1: VITE_MOCK_TIME - Set a specific date AND time (ISO format)
# This completely overrides both the date and time
# Examples:

# 1. Testing the Global Easter Period (spans ~50 hours):
# Easter 2025 is April 20, but the "global Easter" spans multiple days

# Start of global Easter (UTC+14 timezone):
VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-19T10:00:00Z  # Midnight April 20 in Kiritimati (UTC+14)

# Other global Easter period times to try:
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-19T18:00:00Z  # Bunny delivering in New Zealand/Australia
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T00:00:00Z  # Bunny delivering in Asia/Europe
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T12:00:00Z  # Bunny delivering in Americas
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-21T11:59:59Z  # End of Easter (UTC-12 timezone)

# 2. Testing specific city visits (the bunny arrives at midnight local time):
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-19T15:00:00Z  # Just as bunny arrives in Tokyo
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T00:00:00Z  # Just as bunny arrives in London
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T05:00:00Z  # Just as bunny arrives in New York

# 3. Testing non-Easter days (sleeping bunny):
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-22T00:00:00Z  # After Easter is over globally
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-03-20T12:00:00Z  # One month before Easter

# Option 2: VITE_MOCK_DATE - Set ONLY the date but use real time of day
# This is useful for testing date-specific behavior while allowing time to progress
# Examples:

# VITE_MOCK_DATE=2025-04-20  # Force the date to be Easter Sunday
# VITE_MOCK_DATE=2025-04-19  # Day before Easter (but still part of global Easter period)
# VITE_MOCK_DATE=2025-04-22  # After Easter (sleeping bunny)

# Note: If both are specified, VITE_MOCK_TIME takes precedence
