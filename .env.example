# Enable debug mode to see current time and Easter status
VITE_DEBUG=true

# There are two ways to override the time for testing:

# Option 1: VITE_MOCK_TIME - Set a specific date AND time (ISO format)
# This completely overrides both the date and time
# Examples:

# Testing on Easter day (April 20, 2025) at different times:
VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T12:00:00Z  # Noon on Easter

# Other Easter day times to try:
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T00:00:00Z  # Start of Easter (midnight)
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T06:00:00Z  # Early morning (6 AM)
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T18:00:00Z  # Evening (6 PM)
# VITE_MOCK_TIME=2025-04-20T23:59:59Z  # End of Easter

# Option 2: VITE_MOCK_DATE - Set ONLY the date but use real time of day
# This is useful for testing date-specific behavior (like Easter day detection)
# while still allowing the time to progress normally
# Examples:

# VITE_MOCK_DATE=2025-04-20  # Force the date to be Easter Sunday (April 20, 2025)
# VITE_MOCK_DATE=2025-04-21  # Day after Easter (sleeping bunny)
# VITE_MOCK_DATE=2025-04-19  # Day before Easter (sleeping bunny)

# Note: If both are specified, VITE_MOCK_TIME takes precedence
