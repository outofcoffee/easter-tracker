## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation
1. Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite project
2. Configure TailwindCSS
3. Set up Leaflet map component
4. Create basic layout and UI components

### Phase 2: Data & Logic
1. Generate worldwide city database
2. Implement journey calculation algorithm
3. Create time-based position tracking
4. Develop basket counter logic
5. Implement GeoJSON-based landmass detection

### Phase 3: Animation & Interaction
1. Design and implement bunny sprite animation
2. Add smooth path transitions
3. Implement location details display
4. Create progress visualisation

### Phase 4: User Location & Personalisation
1. Add geolocation detection
2. Implement nearest city calculation
3. Create local arrival time estimation
4. Add special "nearby" notifications

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimisation
1. Refine UI/UX for child-friendliness
2. Add Easter-themed decorations
3. Optimise for performance
4. Add loading states and error handling
5. Test across devices and browsers

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Global City Database**: Creating a comprehensive but optimised list of worldwide cities
2. **Time-Based Positioning**: Calculating the bunny's position based on current time
3. **Smooth Animation**: Ensuring fluid movement along the journey path
4. **Performance**: Keeping the application responsive with animations and map rendering
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent experience across devices
6. **Accurate Landmass Detection**: Reliably determining land vs. water for the bunny's journey

## Landmass Detection Implementation

### Implementation Approach
We implemented a more accurate and reliable landmass detection system using the `@geo-maps/earth-lands-10m` dataset and Turf.js for geospatial operations.

1. **GeoJSON-Based Detection**:
   - Implemented `landmassDetectorGeoJSON.ts` using the `@geo-maps/earth-lands-10m` dataset
   - Integrated with Turf.js for efficient point-in-polygon operations
   - Improved accuracy and reliability for global landmass detection

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Changed error handling to default to 'is land = true' for reliability
   - This ensures the Easter Bunny will always remain visible to users
   - Errors are still logged to console for debugging purposes

3. **Simplified Landmass Naming**:
   - Using a simple "Land" designation for all landmasses
   - Removed complexity from continent detection
   - Made implementation more resilient

4. **Caching Mechanism**:
   - Implemented coordinate caching for performance optimization
   - Precise coordinate rounding to about 100m precision
   - Cache size limitation to prevent memory issues

### Dependencies Added
- `@geo-maps/earth-lands-10m`: High-quality GeoJSON data of Earth's landmasses
- `@turf/boolean-point-in-polygon`: Efficient point-in-polygon detection
- `@turf/helpers`: Utility functions for GeoJSON operations

### Key Benefits
1. **Improved Accuracy**: The GeoJSON dataset provides higher resolution and better coverage
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes all major and minor landmasses worldwide
3. **More Reliable**: Dependencies on external libraries and data are properly managed
4. **Maintainable Code**: Simpler implementation with fewer special cases
5. **Better Error Handling**: Default to land in case of failure for improved UX

### Specific Issues Fixed
1. **Indiana Coordinates**: Properly identifies coordinates in Indiana (38.3732, -86.8663) as land
2. **UK Detection**: Correctly identifies all UK locations including Belfast (54.5973, -5.9301) and Cornwall (50.1167, -5.4164)
3. **Water Detection**: Accurately detects oceans, seas, and other water bodies

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Dedicated tests for landmass detection edge cases
- Component tests for UI elements
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for animation smoothness

## Future Enhancements
- Social sharing functionality
- Interactive mini-games while waiting
- Custom messages for specific locations
- Historical journey replay
- Multiple language support
- More detailed landmass names (countries, regions)
- Performance optimizations for faster geospatial lookups
